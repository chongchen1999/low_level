# ELF (Executable and Linkable Format)

## Overview

ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) is the standard binary file format for executable files, object code, shared libraries, and core dumps on Unix and Unix-like operating systems such as Linux, Solaris, and FreeBSD. This format replaced older formats like a.out and COFF, providing more flexibility and functionality.

## Features

- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Works across different processor architectures
- **Dynamic linking support**: Enables shared libraries and reduces executable size
- **Extensibility**: Designed to be extended as new features are needed
- **Debugging support**: Contains sections for debugging information
- **Efficient memory mapping**: Structure allows for efficient loading into memory

## Structure

An ELF file consists of the following main components:

- **ELF Header**: Contains metadata about the file (magic number, class, data encoding, version, etc.)
- **Program Headers**: Describes segments used at runtime
- **Section Headers**: Describes sections containing data for linking and relocation
- **Data**: The actual code, data, and metadata organized in sections

## Common Tools for Working with ELF Files

- `readelf`: Display information about ELF files
- `objdump`: Display information from object files
- `nm`: List symbols from object files
- `ldd`: Print shared library dependencies
- `objcopy`: Copy and translate object files
- `strip`: Discard symbols from object files

## Example Usage

```bash
# View ELF header
readelf -h /bin/ls

# List all sections
readelf -S /bin/ls

# Display program headers
readelf -l /bin/ls

# View dynamic section
readelf -d /usr/lib/libc.so.6

# List symbols
nm /bin/ls
```
